# Biokinetics Model for Internal Occupational Pu-239 Exposure

Welcome! \
-> This repository provides an editable biokinetics model for a internal occupational Pu-239 exposure, outputting the corresponding activity, absorbed dose, equivalent dose, and effective dose based on the time and Pu-239 mass inputs. \
-> The model is created based off a simplified 4-compartment differential equations system of the body (lungs, blood, liver, and skeleton.) \
-> A full outline of the theoretical exposure scenario and theory behind the model is provided in the project paper in this repository.
